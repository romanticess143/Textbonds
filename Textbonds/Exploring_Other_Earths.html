				<h2>By NASA'S Jet Propulsion Lab</h2>

				<p id="P1">Scientists are getting closer to finding worlds that resemble our own "blue marble" of a planet. NASA's Kepler mission alone has confirmed more than 1,000 planets outside our solar system -- a handful of which are a bit bigger than Earth and orbit in the habitable zones of their stars, where liquid water might exist. Some astronomers think the discovery of Earth's true analogs may be around the corner. What are the next steps to search for life on these potentially habitable worlds? <i onclick="myFunction()" class = "fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i></p>

					<p><strong>I agree that</strong><em> we will find Earth-like exoplanets soon because it seems wrong to assume that we live on a one-of-a-kind planet. Most objects in our universe can be categorized into groups, such as Jovian planets or asteroids. As we discover more and more exoplanets, eventually we will find what we are looking for, other Earths!</em></p>

				<p id="P2">Scientists and engineers are actively working on two technologies to help with this challenge: the starshade, a giant flower-shaped spacecraft; and coronagraphs, single instruments that fit inside telescopes. Both a starshade and a coronagraph block the light of a star, making it easier for telescopes to pick up the dim light that reflects off planets. This would enable astronomers to take pictures of Earth-like worlds -- and then use other instruments called spectrometers to search the planets' atmospheres for chemical clues about whether life might exist there. <i class = "fa fa-question-circle-o"></i></p>

				<p id="P3">"Coronagraphs are like visors in your car -- you use them to block the light of the sun so you can see the road," said Nick Siegler, the program chief technologist for NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program Office at JPL. "Starshades, on the other hand, are separate spacecraft that fly in front of other telescopes, so they are more like driving behind a big truck in front of you to block the light of the sun." <i class = "fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>
